# MAF Declarative Workflows

## Overview

Declarative workflows in Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) Python define orchestration logic using YAML configuration files instead of programmatic code. Describe *what* a workflow should do rather than *how* to implement it; the framework converts YAML definitions into executable workflow graphs.

This YAML-based paradigm is completely different from programmatic workflows. Use it when configuration-driven flows are preferred over code-driven orchestration.

## When to Use Declarative vs. Programmatic Workflows

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Standard orchestration patterns | Declarative |
| Workflows that change frequently | Declarative |
| Non-developers need to modify workflows | Declarative |
| Complex custom logic | Programmatic |
| Maximum flexibility and control | Programmatic |
| Integration with existing Python code | Programmatic |

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.10–3.13, `agent-framework-declarative` package (`pip install agent-framework-declarative --pre`), and basic YAML familiarity. Python 3.14 is not yet supported in the baseline docs at the time of writing.

## Basic YAML Structure

Define workflows with these elements (root-level pattern):

```yaml
name: my-workflow
description: A brief description of what this workflow does

inputs:
  parameterName:
    type: string
    description: Description of the parameter

actions:
  - kind: ActionType
    id: unique_action_id
    displayName: Human readable name
    # Action-specific properties
```

| Element | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier for the workflow |
| `description` | No | Human-readable description |
| `inputs` | No | Input parameters the workflow accepts |
| `actions` | Yes | List of actions to execute |

Advanced docs may also show a `kind: Workflow` + `trigger` envelope for trigger-based workflows. Use the shape documented for your targeted runtime.

## Variable Namespace Overview

Organize state with five namespaces. Use full paths (e.g., `Workflow.Inputs.name`) in expressions; literal values omit the `=` prefix.

| Namespace | Access | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `Local.*` | Read/Write | Temporary variables during execution |
| `Workflow.Inputs.*` | Read-only | Input parameters passed to the workflow |
| `Workflow.Outputs.*` | Read/Write | Values returned from the workflow |
| `System.*` | Read-only | System values (ConversationId, LastMessage, Timestamp) |
| `Agent.*` | Read-only | Results from agent invocations |

## First Example Walkthrough

Create a greeting workflow that uses variables and expressions.

**Step 1: Create the YAML file (`greeting-workflow.yaml`)**

```yaml
name: greeting-workflow
description: A simple workflow that greets the user

inputs:
  name:
    type: string
    description: The name of the person to greet

actions:
  - kind: SetVariable
    id: set_greeting
    displayName: Set greeting prefix
    variable: Local.greeting
    value: Hello

  - kind: SetVariable
    id: build_message
    displayName: Build greeting message
    variable: Local.message
    value: =Concat(Local.greeting, ", ", Workflow.Inputs.name, "!")

  - kind: SendActivity
    id: send_greeting
    displayName: Send greeting to user
    activity:
      text: =Local.message

  - kind: SetVariable
    id: set_output
    displayName: Store result in outputs
    variable: Workflow.Outputs.greeting
    value: =Local.message
```

**Step 2: Load and run from Python**

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from agent_framework.declarative import WorkflowFactory


async def main() -> None:
    factory = WorkflowFactory()
    workflow_path = Path(__file__).parent / "greeting-workflow.yaml"
    workflow = factory.create_workflow_from_yaml_path(workflow_path)

    result = await workflow.run({"name": "Alice"})
    for output in result.get_outputs():
        print(f"Output: {output}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Expected output**: `Hello, Alice!`

## Action Type Summary

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| Variable Management | `SetVariable`, `SetMultipleVariables`, `AppendValue`, `ResetVariable` |
| Control Flow | `If`, `ConditionGroup`, `Foreach`, `RepeatUntil`, `BreakLoop`, `ContinueLoop`, `GotoAction` |
| Output | `SendActivity`, `EmitEvent` |
| Agent Invocation | `InvokeAzureAgent` |
| Human-in-the-Loop | `Question`, `Confirmation`, `RequestExternalInput`, `WaitForInput` |
| Workflow Control | `EndWorkflow`, `EndConversation`, `CreateConversation` |

## Expression Basics

Prefix values with `=` to evaluate at runtime. Unprefixed values are literals.

```yaml
value: Hello                    # Literal
value: =Concat("Hi ", Workflow.Inputs.name)  # Expression
```

Common functions: `Concat`, `If`, `IsBlank`. Operators: comparison (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical (`And`, `Or`, `Not`), arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

## Control Flow and Output

Use **If** for conditional branching (`condition`, `then`, `else`). Use **ConditionGroup** for multi-branch routing (first matching condition wins). Use **Foreach** to iterate collections; **RepeatUntil** to loop until a condition is true. Use **BreakLoop** and **ContinueLoop** inside loops for early exit or skip. Use **GotoAction** with `actionId` to jump to a labeled action for retries or non-linear flow.

Send messages with **SendActivity** (`activity.text`); emit events with **EmitEvent**. Store results in `Workflow.Outputs.*` for callers. Use **EndWorkflow** to terminate execution.

## Agent and Human-in-the-Loop

Invoke Azure AI agents with **InvokeAzureAgent**. Register agents via `WorkflowFactory.register_agent()` before loading workflows. Use `input.externalLoop.when` for support-style conversations that continue until resolved.

For interactive input: **Question** (ask and store response), **Confirmation** (yes/no), **RequestExternalInput** (external system), **WaitForInput** (pause until input arrives).

### Provider and Version Caveats

- Keep YAML examples aligned to the runtime shape used by your target SDK version.
- Validate Python version support against current declarative workflow release notes before deployment.
